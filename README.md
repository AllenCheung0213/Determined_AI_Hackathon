# Determined_AI_Hackathon MedMNIST Active Learning Project
This repository contains code for my submission to the Determined AI Hackathon, a project built using Determined AI's open-source, enterprise-grade platform. The project aims to demonstrate the power and versatility of Determined AI in training and managing deep learning models through a unified platform.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to explore active learning techniques for image classification within the medical imaging domain using the PathMNIST dataset. We aim to train a ResNet-50-based model that achieves high accuracy with minimal labeled data by employing uncertainty and diversity sampling strategies.

## Dataset

We used the **PathMNIST** dataset from the [MedMNIST dataset collection](https://medmnist.com/). The dataset consists of 107,180 images (split into training, validation, and testing subsets), each 28x28 pixels in size, categorized into 9 types of pathological tissues.

### Facts about PathMNIST

- **Data Modality:** Colon Pathology
- **Task:** Multi-Class (9)
- **Number of Samples:** 107,180 (89,996 training / 10,004 validation / 7,180 test)
- **Source Data:**

## Sample Data

Below is an example image from the PathMNIST dataset:

| Image  | Label |
|--------|-------|
| ![Sample Image](images/PathMNIST.png) | `0` (Normal Tissue) |

**Tensor Values** (Partial):
```python
Image: tensor([[[0.7255, 0.7176, 0.7255,  ..., 0.7255, 0.7176, 0.7333],
         [0.7098, 0.7255, 0.7176,  ..., 0.5451, 0.5059, 0.4902],
         [0.7255, 0.7255, 0.7176,  ..., 0.6314, 0.6235, 0.6392],
         ...,
         [0.7098, 0.7020, 0.7333,  ..., 0.7333, 0.7255, 0.7333],
         [0.6706, 0.7020, 0.7333,  ..., 0.7333, 0.7333, 0.7333],
         [0.6863, 0.7255, 0.7333,  ..., 0.7255, 0.7333, 0.7412]],
        ...
       ])
```
The label for the sample is 
```python
Label: [0]
```

## Model Architecture

The model used is a custom ResNet-50-based architecture with modifications to fit the 28x28 image input and 9-class output of the PathMNIST dataset:
- **Base Model**: ResNet-50
- **Customizations**:
  - Initial convolution layer adjusted to accept 28x28 input images.
  - Max pooling layer removed to retain spatial dimensions.
  - Fully connected layer modified to output predictions for 9 classes.

## Training Instructions

To train the model, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AllenCheung0213/Determined_AI_Hackathon
   cd Determined_AI_Hackathon
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Install Determined:
- [Determined Quick Installation](https://docs.determined.ai/latest/get-started/basic.html#basic)

4. Run the training script:
    ```bash
    det e create config.yaml .
    ```

5. Track training metrics using the DeterminedAI WebUI.

## Best Metrics Screenshot

The following plot illustrates the validation loss over training batches during the active learning process. The consistent decrease in validation loss demonstrates the effectiveness of the active learning strategy in improving model performance.

Here is a screenshot of the validation loss metric from the DeterminedAI WebUI:

![Validation Loss](images/val_loss_metrics.png)

- **Validation Loss**: The graph shows a steady decline, indicating successful learning and convergence.
- **Batches**: Represents the number of iterations over the dataset.

Here is a screenshot of the train loss metric from the DeterminedAI WebUI:

![Train Loss](images/train_loss_metrics.png)

- **Train Loss**: The graph shows variation but overall a steady decline, indicating successful learning and convergence.
- **Batches**: Represents the number of iterations over the dataset.

Here is a screenshot of the batch workload metric from the DeterminedAI WebUI:

![Batch Workload](images/workloads_metrics.png)

- **Validation Loss/Test Loss**: The table shows a steady decline, indicating successful learning and convergence.
- **Batches**: Represents the number of iterations over the dataset.

## Evaluation

The model was evaluated on the validation set of PathMNIST using the following metrics: 
- **Validation Loss**: Measures the model's error on the validation dataset.
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correctly classified images.

### Comparison with Benchmark
In the original MedMNIST v2 study, baseline models achieved an accuracy of 91.1% on the PathMNIST dataset. Our implementation achieved the following results:

- **Accuracy (Best):** 94.04%
- **Loss (Best):** 0.1775

This demonstrates a 3% improvement over the baseline accuracy, highlighting the effectiveness of our active learning approach combined with a custom ResNet-50 architecture.
